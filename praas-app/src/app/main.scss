/*
See .underline class for an example of creating a global instance of a mixin...

NOTE:
- within a mixin, no variables are accessible (without importing
  them);
- importing partials from within a partial is considered a
  poor practice.
- the solution is to make each mixin accept parameters and provide
  default parameters;
- since we may or may not be creating a global instance of a style
  that uses the mixin, start the mixin name with an underscore as
  a convention, so that user/app level style sheet can 'include'
  the mixin into a class of their own.
